    As with traditional medicine, cupping is a very empirical medicine. Current medical scientists are not trying to prove its effectiveness, but the experience of many people over a long period of time has proven the effect of healing the body.

    Cupping therapy is a very safe and effective treatment method if only a few precautions are followed.  
    %br
    Suction from cupping draws fluid into the treated area. This suction force expands and breaks open tiny blood vessels (capillaries) and cells under the skin. Your body treats the cupping area like an injury. It sends more blood to the area to stimulate the natural healing process. Some people theorize that cupping clears the pores and releases toxins.

    I) The patient should select a comfortable position. Usually it takes 5 to 30 minutes and the patient can not move during the treatment.
    %br
    2) It is not advisable to apply cupping to the patient with skin ulcer, edema, or on an area overlying large blood vessels, to the patient with high fever and convulsion; or to the abdominal and sacral regions of the pregnant women. 
    %br
    3) It is not suitable to apply cupping to the patient susceptible to spontaneous bleeding or endless bleeding after trauma. If you take a blood thinner and are susceptible to spontaneous bleeding, consult your physician.

    4) After cupping, there is a blood stasis or bruise at the local area. Generally, it will disappear several days later.

    Cupping therapy and Acupuncture are combined to treat the patients in my practice for the best result.

      Increased blood flow enables your body to dispose of toxins, restores lymphatic circulation, and helps remove edema (excess fluid), which helps reduce the appearance of scarring. Studies have shown the positive effects of cupping on stretch marks and scars even in areas that are far from the area where the cups are applied.

      Cupping helps to engage the parasympathetic nervous system, which increases blood flow to the digestive tract. Gentle cupping over the abdomen also stimulates the insides of your digestive organs. It aids in peristalsis (contractions that push food through your digestive tract), helps clear colon blockages, encourages blood and body-fluid to move through your organs, and helps relieve indigestion.

      Cupping is fairly safe, as long as you take from a trained health professional. But you could have these side effects in the area where the cups touch your skin:
      %br
      %br

      %li Mild discomfort
      %li Bruises
      %li Blisters
      %li Mild fatigue
      %br
      %br
      But no need to worry. This is because the principle of it is to intentionally injure and draw out the healing power of the body. Talk to your doctor about any discomfort after treatment and if you have sensitive skin, tell your doctor before treatment.
