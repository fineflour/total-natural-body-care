      Cupping is a treatment method that has been traditionally used in Asian medicine for thousands years.
      %br
      %br
      The cupping method has the function of warming and promoting the free flow of Qi and blood in the meridians, dispelling cold dampness, diminishing swellings and pains. In clinics, the cupping method is mainly used to treat pain syndrome caused by wind dampness, such as pain of the low back, shoulders, and leg, gastrointestinal disorders such as stomach ache, vomiting, and diarrhea, and lung disease such as cough and asthma. The cupping method combined with bloodletting is suitable to treat acute sprains accompanied by blood stasis.

      From Olympic athletes to pregnant pop-stars, people are rediscovering the benefits of cupping. Maybe you’ve even seen people at your gym or swimming pool with those tell-tale red circles on their backs and shoulders. It’s becoming more common for people to request cupping to relieve chronic muscle soreness. But did you know that cupping can be used to treat many other complaints?

      Cupping therapy is a very safe and effective treatment method if only a few precautions are followed.  
      %br
      %br
      I) The patient should select a comfortable position. Usually it takes 5 to 30 minutes and the patient can not move during the treatment.
      %br
      2) It is not advisable to apply cupping to the patient with skin ulcer, edema, or on an area overlying large blood vessels, to the patient with high fever and convulsion; or to the abdominal and sacral regions of the pregnant women. 
      %br
      3) It is not suitable to apply cupping to the patient susceptible to spontaneous bleeding or endless bleeding after trauma. If you take a blood thinner and are susceptible to spontaneous bleeding, consult your physician.
      %br
      4) After cupping, there is a blood stasis or bruise at the local area. Generally, it will disappear several days later.

      In my opinion, as with most traditional medicine, cupping therapy is an experiential medicine. Even though the current medical scientist is not willing to prove it works, however, through the experience of many people over the time, its effectiveness for healing the body has been proved.
      %br
      %br
      Suction from cupping draws fluid into the treated area. This suction force expands and breaks open tiny blood vessels (capillaries) and cells under the skin. Your body treats the cupping area like an injury. It sends more blood to the area to stimulate the natural healing process. Some people theorize that cupping clears the pores and releases toxins.

      Cupping therapy and Acupuncture are combined to treat the patients in my practice for the best result.

        In traditional Chinese medicine, we look at the face as a reflection of what’s going on inside. We look at your internal well-being to decipher what’s going on. From the inside, we will make that change, and it will be reflected on the outside. In other words, the lasting solution to your breakouts or sagging skin might not be a cream or device, but rather a healthier, more balanced body.

        By helping return balance to these elements, acupuncture serves as a powerful home base on the journey of weight loss. It can kick-start many positive changes within the body, including changes in hunger, fat storage, and feelings of fullness - all significant steps in the right direction.

        Acupuncture can be used to aid in treatment of addiction and to help patients to reduce prescribed medications which are difficult to withdraw from. Acupuncture treatment reduces withdrawal symptoms, aids in relaxation in cases of anxiety, improves sleep, and reduces cravings for drugs.

        Acupuncture treates chronic Pain, Including for the Back, Neck, Knee or Arthritis Pain. The researchers reviewed clinical trials involving over 17,000 patients, and the results showed that patients receiving acupuncture had less pain than patients in the placebo control group for back and neck muscle aches and pain, osteoarthritis, and chronic headaches. (6) The conclusion was that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain and is “more than just a placebo effect, therefore it’s a reasonable referral option for doctors.”

        Some early research has showing new information about the effectiveness of  acupuncture on Parkinson’s. Studies show that can relieve age-related cognitive decline symptoms as it generates a neural response in areas of the brain — such as the putamen and the thalamus — that are particularly affected by Parkinson’s disease.
        
        In a 2002 study done by the Department of Neurology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, after 20 Parkinson’s patients were treated with acupuncture for 16 sessions, 85 percent of patients reported subjective improvements of individual symptoms, including tremor, walking, handwriting, slowness, pain, sleep, depression and anxiety. There were no adverse effects.

    %div
      %h2.title.is-4.has-text-justified
        While most people notice a marked improvement in their symptoms following acupuncture, some feel worse before they start feeling better. In natural medicine circles, this is sometimes referred to as a healing crisis. The idea is that as your body starts undergoing the changes involved in moving toward health, things get stirred up. This can cause not only an exacerbation of current symptoms but also the recurrence of previous ailments that had been dormant.
        
        Acupuncture awakens your self-healing capabilities. With that can come an onslaught of bodily awareness. This usually is a positive experience but it also can mean heightened sensitivity or intolerance for things that previously felt normal. An example of this is someone who unconsciously adapts to stress by tightening and hunching up his shoulders. After an acupuncture treatment, once this person’s bodily felt sense has been woken up, his mild upper back and neck tension might start screaming.
        
        The good news about this side effect is that it’s a sign that things are moving. In the case of acupuncture, this means that the primary objective is being met. That is, you are starting to transition on multiple levels from stuck to unstuck.

        People can feel wiped out after acupuncture. A more common result is increased energy but sometimes the “acu land” effect hangs on a little longer. This is your body telling you that it’s depleted. Feeling fatigued after acupuncture is not cause for concern but it is a warning sign that you need to rest.
        
        If you have this experience, take it easy for the remainder of the day. Take a bath that night. Go to bed early. Come morning, the combination of acupuncture and rest will leave you feeling born again.
    %h4{:class => "title.is-3"}
      %a{:href => "#"} Soreness
    %div
      %h2.title.is-4.has-text-justified
        Body parts where acupuncture needles get inserted can feel sore after needles are removed. I’ve found that this most commonly occurs with points in the hands and feet, especially Large Intestine 4, an acupuncture point located between the thumb and index finger. You also may experience muscle soreness away from the needling site if a trigger or ashi point was released during your treatment.
        
        Soreness from acupuncture typically dissipates within 24 hours. However, big trigger point releases can cause residual soreness that lasts a few days. Most acupuncturists will warn you about this before you leave your appointment.
    %h4{:class => "title.is-3"}
      %a{:href => "#"} Bruising
    %div
      %h2.title.is-4.has-text-justified
        Although less common than soreness, bruising can occur at the needling site. Sometimes bruising is the result of a hematoma, a localized collection of blood that gets initiated when the needle punctures the skin. Bruises, unfortunately, usually last longer than soreness from an acupuncture needle. Still, they generally are not anything to worry about beyond the aesthetic inconvenience.
        
        It is unknown why some people bruise from acupuncture. I have a few patients who, no matter what I try in terms of needle brand, size or technique, they bruise every time. (Again, I often see it happen at Large Intestine 4.) Others—the majority—never experience bruising anywhere.

      %h2.title.is-4.has-text-justified
        Every time I get acupuncture, no matter where the needles are placed, my right quadricep muscle twitches like crazy. Don’t ask me why. People may experience involuntary muscle twitching during or after acupuncture. I’ve seen this occur in muscles that receive acupuncture needles and, as in my case, on seemingly random parts of the body that are far away from any needles.
        
        Muscle twitching is different from full-on muscle spasm. If during or after an acupuncture treatment you feel that one of your muscles is acutely spasming, especially if it’s a muscle that was just needled, tell your acupuncturist. He or she might be able to release it before you go on your merry way.
    %h4{:class => "title.is-3"}
      %a{:href => "#"} Emotiona Release
    %h2.title.is-4.has-text-justified
      Sometimes people cry in acupuncture. Not because they’re in pain but because their emotions, which often get stifled while powering through life, become free flowing. The emotional release that can happen in acupuncture usually is a positive experience, but it can be surprising, especially for people who tend to be more emotionally stoical.
      
      Feeling extra sensitive or tear prone in an acupuncture session, or in the days that follow, is completely normal. It’s also a sign that the acupuncture is working. Even if you’re seeking acupuncture for a physical ailment, increased emotional expression is an indication that healing is happening. From an acupuncture perspective, physical and emotional health are interconnected, so emotional shifts suggest forthcoming physical changes as well.
