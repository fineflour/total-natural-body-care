    Cupping is a very empirical medicine as a traditional medicine. Current medical scientists are not trying to prove its effectiveness, but over a long period of time, the experience of many people has proven its healing effect. When used in conjunction with acupuncture, the maximum therapeutic effect can be achieved.

    Suction from cupping draws fluid into the treated area. This suction force expands and breaks open tiny blood vessels (capillaries) and cells under the skin. Your body treats the cupping area like an injury. It sends more blood to the area to stimulate the natural healing process. Some people theorize that cupping clears the pores and releases toxins.

    Cupping helps to engage the parasympathetic nervous system, which increases blood flow to the digestive tract. Gentle cupping over the abdomen also stimulates the insides of your digestive organs. It aids in peristalsis (contractions that push food through your digestive tract), helps clear colon blockages, encourages blood and body-fluid to move through your organs, and helps relieve indigestion.
