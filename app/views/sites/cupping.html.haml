      Cupping is a treatment method that has been traditionally used in Asian medicine for thousands years.

      %br
      The cupping method has the function of warming and promoting the free flow of Qi and blood in the meridians, dispelling cold dampness, diminishing swellings and pains. In clinics, the cupping method is mainly used to treat pain syndrome caused by wind dampness, such as pain of the low back, shoulders, and leg, gastrointestinal disorders such as stomach ache, vomiting, and diarrhea, and lung disease such as cough and asthma. The cupping method combined with bloodletting is suitable to treat acute sprains accompanied by blood stasis.

      From Olympic athletes to pregnant pop-stars, people are rediscovering the benefits of cupping. Maybe you’ve even seen people at your gym or swimming pool with those tell-tale red circles on their backs and shoulders. It’s becoming more common for people to request cupping to relieve chronic muscle soreness. But did you know that cupping can be used to treat many other complaints?

      Cupping therapy is a very safe and effective treatment method if only a few precautions are followed.  
      %br
      %br
      I) The patient should select a comfortable position. Usually it takes 5 to 30 minutes and the patient can not move during the treatment.
      %br
      2) It is not advisable to apply cupping to the patient with skin ulcer, edema, or on an area overlying large blood vessels, to the patient with high fever and convulsion; or to the abdominal and sacral regions of the pregnant women. 
      %br
      3) It is not suitable to apply cupping to the patient susceptible to spontaneous bleeding or endless bleeding after trauma. If you take a blood thinner and are susceptible to spontaneous bleeding, consult your physician.
      %br
      4) After cupping, there is a blood stasis or bruise at the local area. Generally, it will disappear several days later.

      As with traditional medicine, cupping is a very empirical medicine. Current medical scientists are not trying to prove its effectiveness, but the experience of many people over a long period of time has proven the effect of healing the body.

      Suction from cupping draws fluid into the treated area. This suction force expands and breaks open tiny blood vessels (capillaries) and cells under the skin. Your body treats the cupping area like an injury. It sends more blood to the area to stimulate the natural healing process. Some people theorize that cupping clears the pores and releases toxins.

        Cupping is a wonderful option to improve fascial mobility and decrease muscle pain. Cupping does not hurt, in fact it helps loosen up the soft tissue and loosen the muscles, it increases the blood flow through tight muscles and works great with improving tissue mobility.

        It reduces varicose veins, spider veins, stretch marks and scars
        Increased blood flow enables your body to dispose of toxins, restores lymphatic circulation, and helps remove edema (excess fluid), which helps reduce the appearance of scarring. Studies have shown the positive effects of cupping on stretch marks and scars even in areas that are far from the area where the cups are applied.

        The massage effect of the cupping promotes deep relaxation to move through your entire body. (Your parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for slowing your heart rate, assisting in digestion, and increasing intestinal and gland activity.)

        Cupping helps to engage the parasympathetic nervous system, which increases blood flow to the digestive tract. Gentle cupping over the abdomen also stimulates the insides of your digestive organs. It aids in peristalsis (contractions that push food through your digestive tract), helps clear colon blockages, encourages blood and body-fluid to move through your organs, and helps relieve indigestion.
