      Contrary to what we may be concerned about, the head is the safest and most painless area for acupuncture. However, the treatment of stimulating the nerves by placing needles on the muscles surrounding the skull brings a unique effect that no other treatment can bring.

    Worsening Symptoms (Healing Crisis)
.container.has-text-justified
  %h3.is-4
    While most people notice a marked improvement in their symptoms following acupuncture, some feel worse before they start feeling better. In natural medicine circles, this is sometimes referred to as a healing crisis. The idea is that as your body starts undergoing the changes involved in moving toward health, things get stirred up. This can cause not only an exacerbation of current symptoms but also the recurrence of previous ailments that had been dormant.
    %br
    %br
        
    Acupuncture awakens your self-healing capabilities. With that can come an onslaught of bodily awareness. This usually is a positive experience but it also can mean heightened sensitivity or intolerance for things that previously felt normal. An example of this is someone who unconsciously adapts to stress by tightening and hunching up his shoulders. After an acupuncture treatment, once this person’s bodily felt sense has been woken up, his mild upper back and neck tension might start screaming.
        
    %br
    %br
    The good news about this side effect is that it’s a sign that things are moving. In the case of acupuncture, this means that the primary objective is being met. That is, you are starting to transition on multiple levels from stuck to unstuck.

    %u Fatigue
  %div
    %h3.is-4.has-text-justified
      People can feel wiped out after acupuncture. A more common result is increased energy but sometimes the “acu land” effect hangs on a little longer. This is your body telling you that it’s depleted. Feeling fatigued after acupuncture is not cause for concern but it is a warning sign that you need to rest.
      %br   
      %br   
      If you have this experience, take it easy for the remainder of the day. Take a bath that night. Go to bed early. Come morning, the combination of acupuncture and rest will leave you feeling born again.

    %u Soreness
  %div
    %h3.is-4.has-text-justified
      Body parts where acupuncture needles get inserted can feel sore after needles are removed. This is most commonly occurs with points in the hands and feet, especially, an acupuncture point located between the thumb and index finger. 
      %br 
      %br   
      Soreness from acupuncture typically dissipates within 24 hours. However, big trigger point releases can cause residual soreness that lasts a few days. Most acupuncturists will warn you about this before you leave your appointment.

  %h3.title.is-4
    %u Bruising
  %div
    %h3.is-4.has-text-justified
      Although less common than soreness, bruising can occur at the needling site. Sometimes bruising is the result of a hematoma, a localized collection of blood that gets initiated when the needle punctures the skin. Bruises, unfortunately, usually last longer than soreness from an acupuncture needle. Still, they generally are not anything to worry about beyond the aesthetic inconvenience.

    %u Lightheadedness and Headache
  %div
    %h3.is-4.has-text-justified
      Patients often experience dizziness or mild headaches as blockages begin to flow after acupuncture. These symptoms last from 24 to up to 72 hours. Do not exercise or work too hard and get plenty of rest. Your symptoms will soon be relieved. Drink plenty of room temperature water.

    %u Muscle Twitching
  %div
    %h2.is-4.has-text-justified
      People may experience involuntary muscle twitching during or after acupuncture. Muscle twitching is different from full-on muscle spasm. If during or after an acupuncture treatment you feel that one of your muscles is acutely spasming, especially if it’s a muscle that was just needled, tell your acupuncturist. He or she might be able to release it before you go on your merry way.

    %u Emotional Release

  %h2.is-4.has-text-justified
    Sometimes people cry in acupuncture. Not because they’re in pain but because their emotions, which often get stifled while powering through life, become free flowing. The emotional release that can happen in acupuncture usually is a positive experience, but it can be surprising, especially for people who tend to be more emotionally stoical.

    %u Spotting and Menstrual Changes

  %h2.is-4.has-text-justified
    Female patients experience spotting, often changes in the menstrual cycle or changes in menstrual volume.
    %br
    As the clogged qi begins to flow after acupuncture treatment, the body cleans itself, balances hormones and regulates menstruation. After one to  three months, menstruation returns to a more normal state than before treatment, and the symptoms that were uncomfortable before and after menstruation are improved.

    %br
    %br
  %h2.title.is-4
    %u Itch 

  %h2.is-4.has-text-justified
    As the Qi, blood and body fluids flow through the clogged parts of the body, the body purges  the damaged cells and begins cell regeneration. As flow resumes and cell regeneration accelerates, you may feel an itch-like itch as new flesh grows under the scab.

    %u Other Symptoms

  %div
    %h2.is-4.has-text-justified
      Depending on the individual, symptoms such as sweating, thirst, increased urine output, increased stool volume, runny nose, and increased sweating may occur. It is a phenomenon in which the body's natural purification accelerates and adapts to the changed environment. These uncomfortable symptoms are a sign that the treatment you have received is healing your body. Continue your treatment.
