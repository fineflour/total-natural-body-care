      If you have skin problems, you need to understand that the environment inside the body is expressed outward.
      Treating only the skin is a low-level approach, and it can come back at any time as long as the root cause still exists.  This is the reason why many patients with troubled skin see effectiveness after applying steroid creams but skin problems occur again soon.

      In my clinical experience, I often see patients suffering from digestive disorders, cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory diseases have skin problems such as athlete's foot, rash, psoriasis, and acne. After a while of treatments, it's not uncommon to see skin improving along with their condition. Our internal condition is always expressed to the outside, both physically and mentally. Those with severe skin diseases can have clean and beautiful skin without side effects or downtime by regenerating damaged skin along with balancing acupuncture, detox, cupping, facial acupuncture and natural masks.

        The effects of cosmetic acupuncture vary. It improves the complexion by helping the blood and lymph circulation of the face, stimulates the dermis layer, which is the core layer of skin regeneration, promotes collagen synthesis, and improves the skin's ability to retain moisture to tighten the skin.

        Beauty acupuncture reduces the size of muscles in the face that have become enlarged due to bad habits, and relaxes the muscles that cause wrinkles in the skin, improving fine lines and making the impression softer.

        You can see the immediate effect with just one treatment, but in order to maintain the effect of the treatment for a long time, it is recommended to perform about 10 treatments at intervals of 1-2 times a week.

        Cosmetic cupping is not only about facial beauty, but also promotes health by stimulating organs related to acupuncture points on the face, thus improving the quality of life. It has the advantage of being safer and more comfortable than acupuncture, and the effect is quick (no down time), so patient satisfaction is also high.
